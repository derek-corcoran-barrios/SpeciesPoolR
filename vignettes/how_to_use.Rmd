)
```

The goal of the `SpeciesPoolR` package is to generate potential species pools and their summary metrics in a spatial way, to install the package you can do it from github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("derek-corcoran-barrios/SpeciesPoolR")
```

No you can load the package

```{r setup}
library(SpeciesPoolR)
```

# Summary metrics

Now that you have in which habitat and where a species can be found, we can generate several summary metrics, we will start by reading in the resulting potential occurrence by species in.
