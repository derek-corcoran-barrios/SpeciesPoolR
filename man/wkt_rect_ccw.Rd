\title{Build a CCW WKT polygon from a shapefile (lon/lat)}
\usage{
wkt_rect_ccw(shapefile)
}
\arguments{
\item{shapefile}{Path to a vector file readable by \code{terra::vect()}.}
}
\value{
A single-length character vector with WKT POLYGON, suitable for GBIF's \code{geometry} param.
}
\description{
Creates a minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) around the provided shapefile and
returns it as a WKT POLYGON in counterâ€‘clockwise order. If the shapefile is
not in lon/lat, it is projected to EPSG:4326.
}
\examples{
f <- system.file("ex/Aarhus.shp", package = "SpeciesPoolR")
wkt <- wkt_rect_ccw(f)
cat(substr(wkt, 1, 60), "...\n")
