\title{Filter Species Presences by Habitat Suitability}
\usage{
make_final_presences(Long_LU_table, Long_Buffer_gbif, LookUpTable)
}
\arguments{
\item{Long_LU_table}{A long-format data frame containing land-use suitability data, as generated by \code{generate_long_landuse_table}.}

\item{Long_Buffer_gbif}{A data frame containing the buffer zones for species presences, typically generated earlier in the workflow.}

\item{LookUpTable}{A data frame containing the lookup table that maps species to suitable habitats.}
}
\value{
A data table with the filtered species presences. The returned data table includes the \code{cell} identifier and the corresponding \code{species} that can thrive in that cell based on the habitat suitability.
}
\description{
This function takes a long-format land-use table, a buffer data frame of species presences, and a lookup table to determine which species can thrive in which habitats. It filters the species presences to include only those cells that are both within the species' buffer zones and have suitable habitats according to the lookup table.
}
\examples{
# Assuming you have the following objects from previous steps:
# Long_LU_table - The long-format land-use suitability table
# Long_Buffer_gbif - The buffer data frame of species presences
# LookUpTable - The lookup table mapping species to suitable habitats

final_presences <- make_final_presences(Long_LU_table, Long_Buffer_gbif, LookUpTable)
